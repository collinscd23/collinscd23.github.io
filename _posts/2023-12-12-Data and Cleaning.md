# NBA DATA over past 10 years
## Introduction
- I wanted to make some comparisons of the top 100 players from each years regualr and off season stats for the NBA. In this blog ill cover the procedure i used to help me find and clean the data from the NBA offical website.
- I found this topic intresting and cool becasue im a big fan of the NBA and basketball in genral. I thought it would be cool to see what intresting correltaions and findings i could while practicing my new learned skills in Data scraping. I think it will also help me to better apperciate the impressive talent and effort it takes to be an NBA player, aswell as the thought that goes into being a data analysis.
- Here are a few questions i wanted Awnsered from my research,
-   1. What player stats are correlated with eachother from the large list of stats collected? Are there any surprising findings?
    2. what does the distribution of "Minutes played" look like thorughout the top 100 players? What does this tell us?
    3. What does the mean of playoff VS regualr season "Mins played" for the middle porportion of players tell us about how teams rotate there talent? Do Bench players get more or less time in the Play off?
    4. How has the game Changed over the Past 10 years. (comparison of "per 48 min' stats and "per possestion" stats)

## Ethical Considerations
- Ethical procautions I took to was doing my research online to find if the NBA allowed webscraping. I found that the NBA allows webscaping for there pages that show past data and are not confortable with current data being scraped and used for sports betting and other facets of money gain. But my use is for personal education.
